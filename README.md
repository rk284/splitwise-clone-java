# ðŸ’¸ Splitwise Clone â€“ Java CLI (Low-Level Design)

A command-line clone of the popular expense-splitting app **Splitwise**, built in **Java** using clean **Object-Oriented Design Principles**  and design patterns, with support for Equal, Exact, and Percent expense types, and features an intelligent **Debt Simplifier** that minimizes transactions using a **Greedy Algorithm**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Purpose

This project was built to:
- Demonstrate strong understanding of **Low-Level Design (LLD)**
- Apply **OOP** concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and the strategy pattern
- Showcase clean and maintainable **Java code**

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸ‘¥ Add multiple users
- âž— Add expenses with split types:
  - Equal
  - Exact
  - Percent
- ðŸ“Š Show balances for users or overall
- ðŸ”„ Simplify debts to minimize transactions

---

## ðŸ§  Design Principles

- **Strategy Pattern** for split calculations
- **Service Layer** for business logic (ExpenseService)
- **Models** for each domain entity (User, Expense, Split, etc.)
- **CLI Controller** for command parsing and interaction
